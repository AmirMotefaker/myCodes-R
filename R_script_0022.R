# R Scatter Plot


# Scatter Plots
# A "scatter plot" is a type of plot used to display the relationship between
# two numerical variables, and plots one dot for each observation.
# It needs two vectors of same length, one for the x-axis (horizontal)
# and one for the y-axis (vertical)

x <- c(5,7,8,7,2,2,9,4,11,12,9,6)
y <- c(99,86,87,88,111,103,87,94,78,77,85,86)

plot(x, y)



# add a header and different labels to describe the scatter plot better
x <- c(5,7,8,7,2,2,9,4,11,12,9,6)
y <- c(99,86,87,88,111,103,87,94,78,77,85,86)

plot(x, y, main="Observation of Cars", xlab="Car age", ylab="Car speed")



# Compare Plots
# To compare the plot with another plot, use the points() function
# day one, the age and speed of 12 cars:
x1 <- c(5,7,8,7,2,2,9,4,11,12,9,6)
y1 <- c(99,86,87,88,111,103,87,94,78,77,85,86)

# day two, the age and speed of 15 cars:
x2 <- c(2,2,8,1,15,8,12,9,7,3,11,4,7,14,12)
y2 <- c(100,105,84,105,90,99,90,95,94,100,79,112,91,80,85)

plot(x1, y1, main="Observation of Cars", xlab="Car age", ylab="Car speed", col="red", cex=2)
points(x2, y2, col="blue", cex=2)
